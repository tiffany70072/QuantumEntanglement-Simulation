# QuantumEntanglement-Simulation

This repository is to simulate quantum entanglement thought experiment, which is our final project in quantum physics lecture (2017 Spring).
* The result demo was uploaded to YouTube: [Rules of Mermin's device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lpYnLXQ9WE).
* The report is the file of quantum-entanglement-fair-sampling-and-reality.pdf in this directory.
